Potato Soup
Yield: About 5 Servings

Ingredients:
6 cups peeled and diced Russet potatoes (about 5 medium potatoes. Dice into small cubes about 3/4-inch)
1 1/2 cups chopped yellow onion (1 medium
1 1/4 cups peeled and diced carrots (3 medium)
1 cup diced celery (2 stalks)
2 (14.5 oz) cans low sodium chicken broth
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/3 cup butter
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
2 1/2 cups milk
1/2 cup sour cream
For serving:
Crumbled bacon or chopped cooked ham , shredded cheddar cheese, chopped green onions or chives

Instructions:
Combine diced potatoes, carrots, celery and onions with chicken broth in a large stockpot. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat (it will take about 10 minutes to reach a boil), once it reaches a boil reduce heat to medium and continue to cook about 15 - 20 minutes longer until potatoes are very soft when pierced with a fork.
Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan melt butter over medium heat, add flour and cook for 1 minute while whisking constantly. While whisking, slowly add milk and cook, stirring constantly until mixture begins lightly bubble and thicken. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Once potatoes are soft add thickened milk mixture to potato soup mixture and stir (potatoes should start breaking down into soup, if not cook a few minutes longer). Add sour cream and mix well. Ladle soup into serving bowls, top each serving with bacon or ham, cheddar cheese and green onions (Note that the soup will thicken as it rests so if you happen to have left overs you can thin with a little water).
